**Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning**

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents based on the comprehensive GUIDE dataset. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by accurately predicting the triage grade of incidents. The model will help SOC analysts prioritize their efforts and respond to critical threats more efficiently.

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting the incident grade based on various features extracted from security alerts. The project involves loading and preprocessing data, splitting and scaling the data, applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance, performing PCA for dimensionality reduction, and training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.

Cybersecurity and Machine Learning

**Data Exploration and Understanding**

Initial Inspection: Load the train.csv dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand the structure of the data, including the number of features, types of variables (categorical, numerical), and the distribution of the target variable (TP, BP, FP).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies in the data. Pay special attention to class imbalances, as they may require specific handling strategies later on.

**Data Preprocessing**

Handling Missing Data: Identify any missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy, such as imputation, removing affected rows, or using models that can handle missing data inherently.

Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from timestamps and encodes categorical variables.Extracts year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and day of the week.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques label encoding depending on the nature of the feature and its relationship with the target variable.

**Data Splitting**

Train-Validation Split: Split the train.csv data into training and validation sets. This allows for tuning and evaluating the model before final testing on test.csv 80-20 split is used.

Stratification: If the target variable is imbalanced, consider using stratified sampling to ensure that both the training and validation sets have similar class distributions.

Model Selection and Training

Baseline Model: Start with a simple baseline model,as a logistic regression to establish a performance benchmark. This helps in understanding how complex the model needs to be.

Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines Each model should be tuned using techniques like grid search or random search over hyperparameters.

Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data. This reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

**Model Evaluation and Tuning**

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using the validation set, focusing on macro-F1 score, precision, and recall. Analyze these metrics across different classes (TP, BP, FP) to ensure balanced performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on the initial evaluation, fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance. This may involve adjusting learning rates, regularization parameters, tree depths, or the number of estimators, depending on the model type.

Handling Class Imbalance: If class imbalance is a significant issue, consider techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), adjusting class weights, or using ensemble methods to boost the model's ability to handle minority classes effectively.

**Model Interpretation**

Feature Importance: After selecting the best model, analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions. This can be done using methods like SHAP values, permutation importance, or model-specific feature importance measures.

Error Analysis: Perform an error analysis to identify common misclassifications. This can provide insights into potential improvements, such as additional feature engineering or refining the model's complexity.

**Final Evaluation on Test Set**

Testing: Once the model is finalized and optimized, evaluate it on the test.csv dataset. Report the final macro-F1 score, precision, and recall to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Comparison to Baseline: Compare the performance on the test set to the baseline model and initial validation results to ensure consistency and improvement.

**Documentation and Reporting**

Model Documentation: Thoroughly document the entire process, including the rationale behind chosen methods, challenges faced, and how they were addressed. Include a summary of key findings and model performance.

Recommendations: Provide recommendations on how the model can be integrated into SOC workflows, potential areas for future improvement, and considerations for deployment in a real-world setting.

**Results**
By the end of the project, learners should aim to achieve the following outcomes:

A machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents (TP, BP, FP) with high macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

A comprehensive analysis of model performance, including insights into which features are most influential in the prediction process.

Documentation that details the model development process, including data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and potential deployment strategies.

**Project Evaluation Metrics**

The success and effectiveness of the project will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

Macro-F1 Score: A balanced metric that accounts for the performance across all classes (TP, BP, FP), ensuring that each class is treated equally.
Precision: Measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model, which is crucial for minimizing false positives.
Recall: Measures the model's ability to correctly identify all relevant instances (true positives), which is important for ensuring that real threats are not missed.
